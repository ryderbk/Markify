Update the CGPA Calculator and CGPA Booster pages:

1) Limit Semesters to 8:
- The “Add Semester” button must stop working once the total reaches 8.
- Hide or disable the button when 8 semesters are shown.
- Do not allow more than 8 GPA inputs to be created.
- If the user tries to exceed 8, show a small message: “Maximum is 8 semesters”.

2) Allow Decimal GPA Input:
- GPA inputs must accept decimal values (e.g., 7.8, 8.25, 9.0).
- Remove restrictions blocking the decimal point.
- Allow only valid GPA numbers from 0.0 to 10.0.
- Still block letters, symbols, or invalid characters.

Keep all other UI, layout, and behavior exactly the same.

Update all input labels in Internal Score:

1) Change every “ASS” label to “Assign”
   (ASS 1 → Assign 1, ASS 2 → Assign 2, ASS 3 → Assign 3)

2) Change every “PRT” label to “Pract”
   (PRT 1 → Pract 1, PRT 2 → Pract 2, PRT 3 → Pract 3)

3) Change “MODEL” to “Model”
   (Model stays with Max: 100)

Apply these changes to both Theory and Integrated layouts.  
Do not change spacing, layout, max values, or styling—only rename the labels.

Fix the Type dropdown in GPA Predictor so it uses the app's standard select component and styling:

- Replace any native or different-select variant with the app's standard rounded pill select used elsewhere.
- Dropdown button and menu must share the same padding, height, font-size, border-radius, background, and text color as other selects.
- Menu width should match the trigger width (no oversized popup). Align the popup under the trigger.
- Use the same caret icon and selected-option check mark as other selects.
- Ensure the open menu has the same glassy background, soft shadow, and rounded corners; option hover + active states must match the app.
- Fix z-index so the menu appears above content without clipping.
- Remove inconsistent large padding / different fonts in the menu items.
- Keep option text exactly: "Theory (Max 40)" and "Integrated (Max 50)".
- No functional changes—only visual/styling consistency.

Apply only to GPA Predictor page.

In the CGPA Booster page:

1) Remove the “Number of Remaining Semesters” input completely.  
   It is not needed because there are always 8 total semesters.

2) New logic:
   Remaining Semesters = 8 − (Number of Completed Semesters entered)

3) Automatically compute remaining semesters in the background without showing a field.

4) If the user enters 8 completed semesters:
   - Show a message: “You have already completed all semesters.”
   - Do not calculate required GPA.

5) If the remaining semesters = 0 or negative, disable calculation.

6) Keep all other UI and behavior the same (target CGPA input, GPA list, result card).

Update the CGPA Calculator card on the main page:

- Replace the graduation cap icon with a clean book icon.
- Use the same style, size, color intensity, and container shape as the other icons.
- Keep the card title “CGPA Calculator” and the subtitle the same.
- Do not change the layout, spacing, or colors of the other cards.

Only update the icon to a book icon that visually matches the rest of the UI.
