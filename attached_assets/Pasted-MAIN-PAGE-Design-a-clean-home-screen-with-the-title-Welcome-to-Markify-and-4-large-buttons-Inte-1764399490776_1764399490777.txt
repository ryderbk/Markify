MAIN PAGE

Design a clean home screen with the title “Welcome to Markify” and 4 large buttons:

Internal Score

Target Sense

GPA Predictor

CGPA Calculator

Each button opens its own tool page. Use smooth transitions and the same UI style everywhere.

🔵 1. INTERNAL SCORE (THEORY / INTEGRATED)

When “Internal Score” is clicked, open the internal-calculation tab I already created:

Two options: Theory and Integrated.

Show the exact two-column layouts I previously defined for both.

Integer-only inputs, max validation, no default assignment marks.

Calculate internal mark using the conversion rules already implemented.

Show only final total in a separate card (no breakdown).

Top-right: Reset button.

(Keep all previous behavior and design as implemented.)

🔵 2. TARGET SENSE (Model Mark Needed)

When “Target Sense” is clicked, open a new page:

Step 1 — Ask Paper Type:

Theory or Integrated.

Step 2 — Ask the inputs based on paper type:

For Theory: CIE1, CIE2, ASS1, ASS2, ASS3, Model (to be calculated).

For Integrated: CIE1, CIE2, CIE3, PRT1, PRT2, PRT3, Model (to be calculated).

Step 3 — Ask the user:

“Enter your Target Internal Score (out of 40 or 50 depending on paper type)”

Step 4 — Output:
Calculate and display the exact MARK NEEDED in Model Exam to reach the target internal score.

If the required model mark is >100 or <0, show a message like “Impossible target” or “Target already achieved.”

🔵 3. GPA PREDICTOR

When “GPA Predictor” is clicked, open a new page:

Step 1: Ask total number of papers.

Step 2: For each paper, show these fields:

Paper Type (Theory/Integrated)

Credits

Internal Score (out of 40 or 50 based on type)

Expected Semester Mark (out of 100)

Step 3 — Calculation:

Convert semester mark to 60 or 50 depending on scheme.

Total = Internal (40/50) + External (converted 60/50).

Determine grade → grade point → multiply by credits.

Predict GPA = total grade points ÷ total credits.

Show final GPA with a summary.

🔵 4. CGPA CALCULATOR

When “CGPA Calculator” is clicked, open a new page:

Step 1: Ask number of semesters completed.
Step 2: Ask GPA for each semester.
Step 3: Output CGPA using the standard weighted formula.

🟣 UI REQUIREMENTS

Default theme: Dark, with toggle.

Use glassmorphism (blur, soft shadows, rounded corners).

Mobile-friendly, clean, centered layout.

Smooth animations, no layout jumps.

Top bar with Back + Reset (only inside tool pages).

No sample button anywhere.

No autosave; leaving a page resets its inputs.

🟢 DELIVERABLE

Create the full multi-tool app with all 4 tabs and working calculations exactly as described.
